# **Entangled Siblings: A Quantum Theatre Audition**  
*A Narrative Game about Quantum Mechanics & Human Connection*

## 🎭 Overview

***Entangled Siblings*** is a **single-player narrative game** built in **Twine** (or similar interactive fiction engine) where you and your virtual partner, Alice, **audition** for an avant-garde play about quantum-entangled twins. To win the roles, you must pass a mysterious “**synchronisation test**”—a direct analogy to the CHSH game from quantum information theory. Through dialogue, discovery, and strategy, you’ll learn core quantum concepts while exploring what it truly means to be “in sync” with another person.

## 🔍 **Highlights**

###  **1. Strong Connection to Course Ideas**
The game integrates key quantum information concepts in an accessible, narrative-driven format:
- **Quantum Entanglement**: metaphor for the "unspoken默契" between the actors.
- **The CHSH Game & Bell’s Inequality** are directly mapped onto the synchronisation test rules and win conditions.
	

- **Superposition & Measurement** are represented through "emotional prompts" (measurement bases) and "performance style" choices (measurement outcomes).
- **Quantum Steering** is reflected in the collaborative, responsive decision-making between the player and Alice.
###  **2. Originality & Creativity**
- **Narrative Hook:** Uses a **theatre audition setting** to explain abstract quantum experiments.  
- **Mechanics as Metaphor:** Game rules mirror CHSH winning conditions.

- **Values-Driven Design:** By emphasizing **_understanding-based默契_** over **deception or genetic relation**, the game models ethical science communication—where knowledge **deepens connection** rather than exploits rules. **This approach mirrors the course’s spirit, turning abstract concepts into a relatable narrative about trust, curiosity, and learning together.**  
###  **3. Accessibility to Non-Specialists**
- Abstract ideas are grounded in relatable scenarios 
- **Progressive learning** via different learning approaches.
	- Pattern analysis, found footage, MCQ, and strategy experimentation
- Emotional engagement through character relationships and shared curiosity.
###  **4. Factual Accuracy**
- All quantum explanations (superposition, entanglement, steering) are based on lecture materials.  
- CHSH win rates (classical ≤75%, quantum ~85%) are correctly represented.
