# **Entangled Siblings: A Quantum Theater Audition**  
*A Narrative Puzzle Game about Quantum Mechanics & Human Connection*

## 🎭 Overview

*Entangled Siblings* is a single-player narrative game built in Twine (or similar interactive fiction engine) where you and your virtual partner, Alice, audition for an avant-garde play about quantum-entangled twins. To win the roles, you must pass a mysterious “synchronization test”—a direct analogy to the CHSH game from quantum information theory. Through dialogue, discovery, and strategy, you’ll learn core quantum concepts while exploring what it truly means to be “in sync” with another person.

## 🔍 Project Alignment with CCST9077 Final Assignment Criteria

### ✅ **1. Strong Connection to Course Ideas**
The game integrates key quantum information concepts in an accessible, narrative-driven format:

- **Quantum Entanglement** → metaphor for the “unspoken默契” between the actors  
- **CHSH Game & Bell’s Inequality** → embedded in the synchronization test mechanics  
- **Superposition & Measurement** → represented through “emotional prompts” and “performance style” choices  
- **Quantum Steering** → reflected in the collaborative decision-making between player and Alice  

### ✅ **2. Originality & Creativity**
- **Narrative Hook:** Uses a theatrical audition setting to humanize abstract quantum experiments.  
- **Mechanics as Metaphor:** Game rules mirror CHSH winning conditions; players experience “quantum advantage” through strategy choice.  
- **Values-Driven Design:** Emphasizes *understanding-based默契* over deception or genetic relation.  
- **Multi-Modal Engagement:** Combines text, choice-based interaction, archival video, and real-time feedback graphs.

### ✅ **3. Accessibility to Non-Specialists**
- No prior quantum knowledge needed.  
- Abstract ideas are grounded in relatable scenarios: acting, partnership, tests, and discovery.  
- Progressive learning via practice rounds, found footage, MC questions, and strategy experimentation.  
- Emotional engagement through character relationships and shared curiosity.

### ✅ **4. Factual Accuracy**
- All quantum explanations (superposition, entanglement, steering) are based on lecture materials.  
- CHSH win rates (classical ≤75%, quantum ~85%) are correctly represented.  
- Interactive Q&A section reinforces correct conceptual understanding.

## 🧠 Educational Approach

The game is designed as a **playful pedagogical tool** that:

1. **Demystifies CHSH/Bell scenarios** by mapping photon measurements to theatrical choices.  
2. **Illustrates quantum–classical divergence** through experiential gameplay (strategy comparison).  
3. **Encourages reflective thinking** about collaboration, intuition, and the nature of connection itself.  
4. **Supports multi-sensory learning** through text, imagery, decision points, and conceptual feedback.
