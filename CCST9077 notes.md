- types of information
	- difference: disorder (thermodynamics)VS order(biology, gene)
-  same? connection?
	- only need probability(some randomness) to define information
	- getting rid of all the external things, e.g. language
	- Challenge: all theories are based on some laws, but how come we derive these basic laws?
		- information can be the one concept to close these problems
		- closed reasoning 
- information is superior
	- physics: start with laws &rarr; derive everything
	- but where does a law come from (infinite regression)
	- answer: information
		- capable of explaining itself
- Why not spontaneous generation of information
	- not faith/ god/ religion
	- infinite regression &rArr; more complex
	- might never get there, but follow the scientific method
	- make sense for oneself
- socially generated construct: emotion/ free will/aesthetic/ love &rArr; no idea
	- quantum physics: grey between black and white
	- probability: something genuinely random
- human information
	- meaningful information: different context
- Are we immortal
	- copy/ ethical issue?
- important phase of development
	- information consistently being created
	- emphasis, explain using a set of only a few rules
	- hope
### L2
**MOORE’S LAW:** #transistors doubles/ 2 year
- summarise, observation
- intel: integrated electronics
- 3nm: r of atoms ~0.1nm, of hair ~50,000nm
- End of Moore's law?
	- new approach: quantum mechanics (state of the atom)&rArr; new type of computers
	- • new units of information: qubits instead of bits
	  • new ways to transmit information: quantum communication
	  • new way to process information: quantum information processing
**Intro to quantum information**
- ball in box
	- definite states
	- superposition states &rarr; probability
	  > scientific method: hypothesis &rarr; experiments
	  
	-  H1: fluid
	- H2: The ball is either on the left or on the right, but we do not know where it is
		- shake the box: swap classic superposition
- Qubits
**uniqueness of quantum information processing**
- no cloning: cannot copy the state of qubits
- cannot be stored in bits


### Midterm concepts review
L1
- What made information technology possible 2+2
- What is information
	- everyday
	- general
- Why is information important (forecast + decision making)
- quantifying information (measuring the amount of information)
	- find out the sequence: by asking questions
- bits (what?>>>unit significance?)
- information processing (bg+3)
	- development 3+4+2+next
	- storage
		- df (store into physical object)
		- physical realisation (encode into the property of the object)
		- compression (prior knowledge)
	- transmission
		- df (move place to place)
		- physical realization(encode, decode, traveling object)
		- special case: storage
	- computation
		- df(input, output, basic operation)
		- physical realization(physical interact)
- information revolution
- it from bit(everything in the universe is made of information)
- Can everything be reduced to information
L2
- Moore's law(what? significance? not law of nature; quantify)
> scientific method (hypotheses+experiment)
- ball in box
	- superposition states
	- state collapse (experiment: change the state of the system)
	- Hype1: superposition state &rArr; always L
	- Hype2: classic state, but we don't know which &rArr; can be R
	- magic shake(L &rarr; super; super &rarr; L )
	- result: always L
- qubits: 2 alternative states+quantum superposition, significance
- quantum information (no cloning + no stored into bits)
	- bits &rarr; qubits
- quantum information processing
	- magic shake, open
- it from qubits (everything in the universe made of qubits)
L3
> linearly polarised photon as qubits
- entanglement
	- bell state (know relation, don't know exact which &lArr; dependence) (new state; not either both L or both R)
	- whole vs part
- spooky action at a distance
	- message transfer no faster than light &rArr; no message transfer
	
- steering
	- **measurement on A** force B to acquire a **definite quantum state**
	- **choice of A's measurement** determines **possible states of B**
> no faster than light communication
> B don't know A's choice of steering or not? -- e.g. H from +45/-45/H

# L4
- EPR paper
	- property(independent of measurement) 
	- reality(local, cannot be affected by another system?)
	- Bell state (incomplete description of reality)
- Bell's theorem (complete)
	- realism (reality independent of measurement)
	- locality (independent of others)
	- local realistic: (complete description of reality) +locality
- Violation of Bell inequality
- True randomness
- device-independent random number generation

Notes:
# L5_modern cryptography
- one-time pad: 1(flip) 0(remain)
	- secure
		- length(key) == length(message)
		- random
		- no recycle
- quantum key distribution (QKD)
	- E91 protocol: pair of entangled quantum
		- Bell state, announce measurement, check result
		- Observation in between must have an influence
	- BB84 protocol: single quantum
		- steps: preparation(A) &rArr; measurement(B) &rArr; shifting(public discussion) &rArr; detection
		- shifting: AB with different measurement &rArr; collapse at B &rarr; dismiss this bit
		- detection: AB same measurement, 50% Eve chooses the wrong measurement &rArr; qubit collapses to the other state &rArr; change the B's observation result &rarr; select random sample bits to test correctness

# Midterm write-up
### logistics
comments, organize them, combine ideas in video and lectures
format: follow up interview/ another scientist who counter some ideas/ time traveller
remark:
- creativity and originallity
- quantum concepts (superposition, entanglement, etc) are concerned, **you are required to describe and explain them using the "magic box" language** (cf. Lectures 1-4) of this course. Please also add references to the origin (e.g., Lecture 3, p 4-5).
-  **a brief statement on the usage of AI** (e.g., "AI has been used to polish the write-up and correct grammar mistakes.").
- plagarism
### video
- why EPR pairs is alternative model for cryptography
	- Einstine &rArr; Bell
	- defining locality, reality
- ==why quantum algorithm is not a growing branch of quantum information today==
	- =="it might be wrong to expect quantum computers to better than classical computer in solving classical and well-defined questions "==
	- entirely new class of algorithms, only for quantum not classic ones 
	  e.g. are 2 quantum entangled
	  &rArr; data structure is define under quantum structure
	- ==quantum simulation== 
	  e.g. biology, photosynthesis, non-trivil, why energy transfer is sufficient? what is the mechanism &rArr; quantum simulation, what is the important factor &rArr; crucial for solar cell technology
	  &rArr; presentation of such question is under quantum structure
	  e.g.
	- ==computation becomes exponentially difficult when particles increases==
- predictions for the next five years
	- development of tools and techniques &rArr; control nature
		- better ==quantum communication==, 
		- quantum cryptography, ==device independent cryptography==
		- ==quantum computing/ others== (apart from quantum simulation)
		  e.g. more accurate clock
	- really explore quantum technology: see the potential
		- ==harness entanglement, superposition==
	- imagine going to the past and interviewing a computer scientist like Charles Babbage
		- speculate the usage and impact of this machine: he will not imagine
	&rArr; ==probably much more ten years later==

### write-up
setup: I'm a time traveller from 2025 to 2015, who is studying basic quantum computing knowledge. I would like to follow up some question that explains quantum application mentioned in the interview, and share the exciting development in quantum technology in the "following 10 years".

format: **story(some narration)** / third party narration/ first angle? (time traveller, scientist)

- mechanism of cryptography model using EPR pairs: **E91 protocol**
	- quantum entanglement
	- Bell state
	- perform same measurement
- some deficiency of E91 protocol?
- "it might be wrong to expect quantum computers to better than classical computer in solving classical and well-defined questions "
	- correct: quantum simulation, new types of computing algorithm
	- more exciting: classic questions that classical computers might not solve due to exponentially growing complexity (exponentially speed up) &rArr; improve efficiency (exponentially faster)
